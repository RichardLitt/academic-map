##  General Description

In order to support the open-source community at UW-Madison and help other universities implement similar changes, the Open Source Program Office will act as a catalyst for institutional change. Nurturing open-source initiatives currently exist on campus, spreading knowledge about the benefits of open-source, establishing ties with collaborators like Madison College and UW-Extension, and taking steps to advance inclusion, diversity, and equity in open-source.

## Core Objectives

- Host a series of workshops with the Office of Business Engagement, the Division of Extension, and the campus open source ecosystem.
- Expanding our existing Open Source Internship program and broaden participation through a partnership with Madison College.
- Host a symposium and training event aimed at growing open source projects and communities.

## Other context

UW–Madison is one of six U.S. higher education institutions recently selected by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation to launch campus OSPOs. Sloan is supporting a total of 12 university OSPOs, including projects selected in earlier funding rounds.

At least initially, the OSPO will be based at the Data Science Institute on the UW-Madison campus. This summer, the institute will hire a program manager and other staff, with the goal of launching the OSPO and its first events this fall.
