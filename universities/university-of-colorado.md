## General Description

> Customized to match campus requirements and cultures, each school contributes Open Educational Resources (OER) expertise, resources, and practices for awareness and adoption to the shared table. By cooperating, the campuses are able to achieve their shared objective of expanding the availability of high-quality OER experiences and lowering student costs.

## Core Objectives

- Ensure that the Open CU campus teams (including teaching and learning centers, libraries, offices of information technology, and accessibility units) continue to deliver high-quality awareness and adoption workshops to additional educators and assisting educators with their course redesign efforts.
- Provide financial incentives to faculty to adapt or create OER content that is fully accessible, discoverable, and openly-licensed.
- Targeting educators teaching high school concurrent enrollment courses for participation.
- Build a cadre of educator experts and advocates who will integrate open education principles into campus academic culture.
