## General Description

> Open Access (OA) is a mechanism by which research outputs are distributed online, free of cost or other access barriers.  Open Access refers to the practice of making peer-reviewed scholarly research and literature freely available online to anyone interested in reading it.


## Core Objectives

- The aim of Open Access publishing is to make research information freely available on the Internet. A very important advantage of OA literature lies in spreading quickly around the world. OA publications are online publications available for reading, downloading, copying, spreading, printing, referencing, publishing and reuse.
