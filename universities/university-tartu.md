## Other context

The current scholarship is behind a pay-wall and only those who can afford access can truly contribute to moving knowledge of a subject forward. Non-Open Access Academic journals can be very expensive, making scholarly research a costly undertaking for someone with a limited research budget. Open Access refers to the practice of making peer-reviewed scholarly research and literature freely available online to anyone interested in reading it.
