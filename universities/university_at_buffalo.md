## Overview  

The University at Buffalo (UB) is a leading research university with a strong focus on materials science, computational modeling, and open-source innovation. The **Department of Materials Design and Innovation (MDI)** integrates data science and materials research, promoting an open-science approach.  UB actively engages in open-source research and community-driven initiatives; however, it does not currently have a formal Open Source Program Office (OSPO).  

## Open Source Science Collaboration  

UB collaborates with the **[Open Source Science Initiative (OSSci)](https://sustainoss.org/academic-map/organizations/OSSci.html)**, focusing on **Chemistry and Materials Science**. 

### Notable Open Source Contributions  

- **Materials Design & Open Data:** UB’s MDI department uses open-source tools for materials discovery and research.
- **Participation in OSSci:** UB researchers work on open computational frameworks to advance reproducibility in materials science.
- **Cross-Disciplinary Collaboration:** UB promotes the intersection of materials science and data-driven methodologies.
