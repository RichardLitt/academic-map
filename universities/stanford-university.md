## General Description

The Stanford Open Source Lab was founded by a group of people from across Stanford who feel that openness matters. Our main visibility at present comes from the open workshops we put on. 
We have high hopes of expanding our work into other areas such as university policy work, open access publishing and software development. Basically anything that will help open access to the knowledge we produce and consume in what ever form that may take.
