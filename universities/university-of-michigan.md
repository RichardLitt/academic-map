## Other context

After a dormant period, today Open Michigan functions as a collaboration between the University of Michiganâ€™s Health Information Technology and Services (HITS) group and the University of Michigan Library. HITS continues to manage the OER collection and provide support to faculty who wish to share their materials online, while the Library maintains a gateway to all things open at the University of Michigan, including open access journals and open data.
