## General Description
The UC OSPO network aims to strengthen collaboration and knowledge-sharing among the campuses, demonstrate the value of a networked approach to supporting open source projects, and identify a resource and governance structure to allow the network to grow and thrive.


## Core Objectives

The UC OSPO Network has three thematic areas: UC OSS projects discovery, OSS sustainability, and training. UC Davis is contributing to all three, with a heavier emphasis on sustainability. Our objectives are to:
* Understand the needs of researchers who use and develop OSS
* Build communities as means towards sustainability
* Provide a self-assessment project health tool
* Pilot a containerization service
* Develop sustainability curriculum
