## Overview

The Open Source Science Initiative (OSSci) is a program run by NumFOCUS that facilitates dialogue between open-source research software communities and researchers. Engaging with over 120 organizations, institutions, and open-source projects, OSSci develops effective shared solutions to challenges faced by the scientific community and supports the emerging generation of scientists relying on open-source tools, data, and code.

## Interest Groups

OSSci has established several interest groups to foster collaboration in specific domains:

- **Climate & Sustainability**
- **Map of Open Source Science (MOSS)**
- **Reproducible Science**
- **Healthcare and Life Sciences**
- **Chemistry and Materials Science**
- **Economics**

Individuals interested in joining these groups can find more information [here](https://chief.sc/ossci-join).
