## Overview
AlmaLinux OS is a community-maintained, open-source Linux distribution that serves as a stable, enterprise-grade alternative to CentOS. It was established in 2021 in response to changes in CentOS's lifecycle. The AlmaLinux OS Foundation, a non-profit organization, leads its development with an emphasis on transparency, collaboration, and inclusivity. AlmaLinux offers long-term support and ensures binary compatibility with Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), catering to diverse use cases in enterprise, cloud, and academic environments.
