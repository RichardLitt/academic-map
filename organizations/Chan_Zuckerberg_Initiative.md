## Overview

The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) is a philanthropic organization dedicated to advancing scientific research, education, and justice through technology-driven solutions. A core pillar of CZI’s mission is supporting open science and open-source software initiatives that drive innovation in biomedical and computational research.

## Open Source Science Support

CZI has played a significant role in funding and advocating for open-source projects critical to scientific progress. Through the **Essential Open Source Software for Science** (EOSS) program, CZI has funded projects that enhance research reproducibility, computational biology, and data accessibility.

### Notable Open Source Science Funding Initiatives
