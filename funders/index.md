# Funders

Open source in academia would not be possible without extensive funding support. This support breaks down in two main ways: governmental bodies and private philanthropy. There are exceptions.

Each country tends to have their own particular funding landscape.

This list is incomplete. Please add to it!

## National Governments

### UK

- [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/)

### USA

- [NSF](https://www.nsf.gov/)
  - [NSF POSE grants](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/pose-pathways-enable-open-source-ecosystems)
  - [NSF Safe-OSE](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/safe-ose-safety-security-privacy-open-source-ecosystems)
  - [NSF GEO OSE](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/geo-ose-geosciences-open-science-ecosystem)

### Aotearoa New Zealand

New Zealand has a complicated funding relationship. Previously, the sciences were all held under the same department, the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. This was split in 1992 into separate [Crown Research Institutes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_Research_Institute) (CRIs).

A full list is [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_Research_Institute).

## Philanthropies

- [The Alfred P. Sloan Foundation](https://sloan.org/)
- [Chan Zuckerberg Initiative](https://chanzuckerberg.com/)
- [Ford Foundation](https://www.fordfoundation.org/)

## Individual Funding Opportunities

The below funding opportunities have been taken from the [open-funding](https://github.com/ralphtheninja/open-funding) github repository and are sub-set of funding specifically relevant to academia.

### [`Protocol Labs Research`](https://github.com/protocol/research#private-retrieval)

#### About

We are looking for research and development of interactive private communication mechanisms.
Commensurate with scope, up to USD 150k per award for research grants and USD 300k per award for implementation grants.
Works we are interested in funding include those which:

Explore new mechanisms for private communication (e.g. with cryptographic, information theoretic, or statistical basis)
Relax the traditional ‘web’ assumptions of a single origin to engage with the possibilities of pre-distributed CDN or content-addressed data.
Prototype the use of novel network-layer privacy technologies in real systems.

#### Eligibility Criteria

Implementation grant
We expect that a team of 2-3 research engineers/developers working for 1-2 years will be sufficient to carry out the prototype development projects envisioned in this call, but we will consider other proposals. Renewals are possible.

#### Application

We encourage you to reach out to `research-grants@protocol.ai` or visit `#private-retrieval` in the Lodestar Discord if you’re considering applying or have any questions.

### [`Chan Zuckerberg Initiative`](https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/)

#### About

Open source software is crucial to modern scientific research, advancing biology and medicine while providing reproducibility and transparency. Yet even the most widely-used research software often lacks dedicated funding. CZI’s Essential Open Source Software for Science program supports software maintenance, growth, development, and community engagement for critical open source tools.

#### Eligibility Criteria

We welcome applications from any country, provided the proposed work is compliant with the United States Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) sanctions program.
Applications may be submitted by non-profit and for-profit organizations, public and private institutions, such as colleges, universities, hospitals, laboratories, units of state and local government, companies, and eligible agencies of the federal government. As part of the full application process, for-profit organizations may need to provide additional information on the charitable purposes of the proposal. Grants are not permitted to individuals; only to organizations. Open source software projects operating independently must be affiliated with an organization, as described below.

#### Application

#### Deadline

Cycle 6 closed in October 2023.
