# Communities and Organizations

Open source in academia is often driven by communities and non-profit organizations that work across institutions, fields, and boundaries.

Right now, these do not have their own pages yet. If you would like to add context about a group, take a look at the [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/sustainers/academic-map/blob/main/contributing.md), which has notes on how to add a page. Any link in **bold** has a page with more context.
