# Software Sustainability Institute

- [Website](https://www.software.ac.uk/)

> The SSI was founded in 2010 as the first organisation in the world dedicated to improving software in research. It was founded on the premise that helping individuals and institutions understand the vital role that software plays in research would accelerate progress in every field of scientific and academic endeavour.

The SSI is connected to the University of Edinburgh, Manchester, and Southampton and is supported by UKRI through the Digital Research Infrastructure programme.
