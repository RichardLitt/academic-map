## Overview

The Turing Way is an open source project that focuses on providing a roadmap and best practices for scientific research. Through a community-driven approach, it helps researchers and data scientists make their work more reproducible, ethical, and inclusive. The open source nature of the project means that anyone can contribute to the content, leading to a diverse and comprehensive resource. The Turing Way website contains a handbook, case studies, resources, and community guidelines, all of which are regularly updated as part of the projectâ€™s ongoing commitment to promote responsible data science. This makes it an indispensable tool for communities that value open science.
