## Overview

The American Chemical Society (ACS) is a scientific society based in the United States that supports scientific research and education in the field of chemistry. Through its numerous publications, ACS provides access to a huge repository of research data and findings. While ACS subscribes to a traditional publication model, some of its journals offer an open access option under ACS AuthorChoice program. According to the ACS website, this program allows authors or their funding institutions to pay a fee to provide free access to their articles immediately upon publication. It encourages the wider dissemination of scientific information, aligning with principles of open source in science.
