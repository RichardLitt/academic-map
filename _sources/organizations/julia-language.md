## Overview

Julia Language is a high-level, high-performance programming language designed for technical computing, with syntax that is familiar to users of other technical computing environments. This language is perfect for numerical computing as it involves a powerful shell for managing other processes. Julia Language plays a significant role in scientific open source arena, as the language itself is explicitly designed to be open, encouraging contributions and collaborations in the form of packages. As an open source language, Julia comes with an extensive range of community-provided packages as well, facilitating its usage in different scientific domains. According to their website, Julia features optional typing, multiple dispatch, and good performance, achieved using type inference and just-in-time compilation, implemented using LLVM. It is also capable of distributing parallel computations across cloud-based infrastructures or locally to multiple cores.
