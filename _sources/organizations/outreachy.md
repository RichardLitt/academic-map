> Outreachy provides internships in open source and open science. Outreachy provides internships to people subject to systemic bias and impacted by underrepresentation in the technical industry where they are living. Outreachy internships are paid, remote, and three-months long.

Outreachy is not only available to students. However, "it is intended to be compatible with student schedules, with mid-year internships corresponding with the summer break of students in the northern hemisphere, and late-year internships corresponding with the summer break of students in the southern hemisphere."

Outreachy was cofounded by [Karen Sandler](http://punkrocklawyer.com/) of the [Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) while she was the ED [the GNOME Foundation](https://foundation.gnome.org/), which is a 501(c)(3) for the GNOME desktop environment for most Linux distros.
