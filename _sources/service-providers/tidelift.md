Tidelift was one of the first organizations to fill a need in open source ecosystems, where it was difficult for large organizations (including universities) to easily pay open source maintainers for their work or for security and reliable maintenance. They bought [Libraries.io](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libraries.io) (which they have since discontinued), and used that to generate a map of major open source dependencies, which they then used to construct packages of repositories which they contacted, arranging to pay maintainers for maintenance of the work, and selling those assurances on to larger companies.
