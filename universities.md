# Universities

University involvement in open source varies widely. For instance, a university could have: a fully structured Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs); a lab or department dedicated to open source; unstructured work done by university staff; investment in open source from libraries or researchers; use of open source edtech internally; taught courses on open source with students; and so on. Because of this, providing a list of universities active in the open source space is hard, and is best thought of as broken down by categories or by usage. 

The following universities have some involvement in open source: 

  - [Carnegie Mellon University](./universities/carnegie-mellon-university.md)
  - [Georgia Institute of Technology](./universities/georgia-institute-of-technology.md)
  - [Johns Hopkins University](./universities/johns-hopkins-university.md)
  - [Rey Juan Carlos University](./universities/rey-juan-carlos-university.md)
  - [Oregon State University](./universities/oregon-state-university.md)
  - Rochester Institute of Technology
  - [UC Santa Cruz](./universities/university-of-california-santa-cruz.md)
